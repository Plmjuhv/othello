## Playing Othello

Input a board size between 4 and 12, must be even due to the starting placement  
Set up the board of the desired size in the starting position  

Place tiles on the board to capture opponent pieces by placing them to form a line that starts with the newly placed piece and ends with a piece of your colour that is already on the board  
Pieces in between the two pieces forming the line flip to your colour  

The game ends when neither player can make a move, either all pieces have been played or no line can be made by either player  
At the end of the game the player with the most pieces on the board of their colour wins
